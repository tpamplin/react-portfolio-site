            <h3>View Coding Events from around the world!</h3>
            <p>
                Meet is a web application built with React, Google Firebase Authentication, and the Google Calendar API. 
                It allows users to browse and discover coding events happening in different cities around the world. 
                Users can filter events by city, authenticate securely, and view detailed information about each event. 
                The app also provides interactive graphs to visualize event data, such as the number of events per city or the distribution of event types.

            <h2>Why Build This Project? </h2>

            <p>
                I created this project as part of the Full Stack Immersion course at
                CareerFoundry. The purpose of this app was to demonstrate my ability to
                use the React framework, as well as recieving information from APIs.
                During the development of this app I dove deep into many web development
                fundamentals, such as:

                            This project took me several months to complete, to my surprise, the
                            API was the easy part. Setting up the database and Express server was
                            fairly straightforward, and did not take that much time. Getting the front
                            end to look and act the way I wanted was much harder and took up the
                            bulk of the time.

            <h2>The Build</h2>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Before diving into building the user interface, I focused on quickly deploying the backend to ensure 
                        a solid foundation for the application. Once the backend was up and running, I shifted my attention 
                        to building the front end using React. This allowed me to create an interactive and responsive user 
                        experience that communicates seamlessly with the back end. The following steps outline how I 
                        approached and completed both the backend deployment and the front end development process.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="grid-section">
                    <div class="grid-unit">
                        <h4>Step 1: Firebase</h4>
                        <p>
                            To handle authentication securely and efficiently, I chose Firebase Authentication. 
                            Setting up Firebase allowed me to quickly implement user sign-up, login, and authentication 
                            flows without building a custom solution from scratch. With Firebase, I could easily manage 
                            user accounts, handle password resets, and ensure secure access to the application. This 
                            foundation made it much easier to focus on building out the rest of the project, knowing that 
                            authentication was robust and scalable.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="grid-unit">
                        <h4>Step 2: User Interface</h4>
                        <p>
                            With the backend in place, I used React to build a responsive and interactive front end. 
                            React’s component-based architecture allowed me to efficiently create reusable UI elements 
                            and organize the user interface. I focused on making the app easy to use and ensuring it 
                            looked good on both desktop and mobile devices. This approach made it straightforward to 
                            update and improve the UI as the project progressed. Additionally, I integrated the Google Calendar API 
                            to fetch and display (fake) real-time coding events from around the world, allowing users to browse, filter, 
                            and view detailed event information directly within the app.

                    <div class="grid-unit">
                        <h4>Step 3: Charts and Styling</h4>
                        <p>
                            In the final step, I focused on styling the application and integrating data visualization. 
                            I used CSS to create a clean look that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. 
                            For data visualization, I implemented interactive charts using the Recharts library. 
                            These charts display useful insights, such as the number of events per city and the distribution 
                            of event types, making the data more engaging and easier to understand for users. This combination 
                            of thoughtful styling and dynamic charts helped bring the application to life and provided a polished 
                            user experience.

            <h2>Testing</h2>

            <p>
                To ensure the Meet application worked as expected, I used Jest and Cucumber for testing. I wrote behavior-driven tests using Gherkin syntax to describe user interactions and application features. These tests helped verify that key functionalities—such as event filtering, authentication, and data visualization—performed correctly. Automated testing with Jest-Cucumber allowed me to catch bugs early and maintain confidence as I added new features.

                    The final Meet application is a single-page web app that brings together all core features in one seamless experience. Users can browse and filter coding events by city, view event details, and interact with dynamic charts—all without navigating away or reloading the page. The intuitive interface, responsive design, and real-time data updates make it easy for users to discover and explore events from anywhere in the world.

                    <h4>How did this project go?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the development of this project, I encountered several challenges that helped me grow as a developer. 
                        One of the main hurdles was integrating third-party APIs, particularly data fetching 
                        from the Google Calendar API. Ensuring secure and seamless authentication with Firebase required careful 
                        configuration and troubleshooting. Additionally, managing asynchronous data flow in React—especially when 
                        dealing with real-time updates and user interactions—proved to be complex at times. Styling the application to be
                        fully responsive across devices also took significant effort, as I wanted the user experience to be consistent and 
                        intuitive. Finally, writing comprehensive tests with Jest and Cucumber was initially challenging, but it ultimately 
                        improved the reliability and maintainability of the codebase.

                    <h4>What would I add or change?</h4>
                    <p>
                        If I were to continue developing this project, I would love to add a few new features. 
                        For example, I could implement a search functionality so users can quickly find events 
                        by keyword or topic in addition to location. Adding user profiles where attendees can save favorite events or RSVP 
                        directly within the app would also enhance the experience. Integrating notifications or email 
                        reminders for upcoming events could help users stay informed. Additionally, I’d like to improve 
                        accessibility and add support for multiple languages to reach a broader audience. Finally, 
                        building an admin dashboard to manage events and moderate content would make the app more robust and scalable.
