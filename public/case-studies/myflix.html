                MyFlix is a web application built with the MERN stack that
                allows users to find more information about their favorite
                movies, like who the director was or what genre it is. Users can
                create an account, log in, and add movies to their list of
                favorites, and they can navigate to their profile to view that list,
                or to make changes to their account.

            <h2>Why Build This Project? </h2>

            <p>
                I created this project as part of the Full Stack Immersion course at
                CareerFoundry. The purpose of this app was to demonstrate my ability to
                build an entire web application, front and back end, from the ground up.
                During the development of this app I dove deep into many web development
                fundamentals, such as:

                            This project took me several months to complete, to my surprise, the
                            API was the easy part. Setting up the database and Express server was
                            fairly straightforward, and did not take that much time. Getting the front
                            end to look and act the way I wanted was much harder and took up the
                            bulk of the time.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Before I could start building the user interface for my app, I needed something to interface with. I needed a place to store
                        information about movies and users, and I needed a way to retrieve that information when I need it. So I built a RESTful API
                        to facilitate this. There were several steps involved in this process.
                    </p>

                <div class="grid-section">
                    <div class="grid-unit">
                        <h4>Step 1: The Database</h4>
                        <p>
                            Due to the nature of the data I was dealing
                            with, I decided a non-relational database
                            would be a good fit for this project.
                            Therefore, I decided to use MongoDB, as it
                            has the flexibility to deal with different
                            movies having different properties. MongoDB
                            was also extremely easy to set up and to
                            host through the integrated hosting solution
                            MongoDB Atlas. 
                        </p>

                    <div class="grid-unit">
                        <h4>Step 2: The Server</h4>
                        <p>
                            Now that I had a functioning database, I
                            needed a server to be able to send requests
                            to, that would process and send back the
                            information I needed from the database
                            when I needed it. I used Express and Node.JS
                            to quickly build a server that I could test
                            with locally. Then I spent a much longer time
                            building out my endpoints so that the server
                            could receive HTTP requests for specific
                            data.

                    <div class="grid-unit">
                        <h4>Step 3: Integration</h4>
                        <p>
                            The final step was to actually connect the
                            server to the database. While this seems
                            straightforward, there were a lot of little
                            steps involved to make sure that I was
                            following the best security practices. From
                            hashing incoming user passwords, to
                            requiring a JWT token to be sent along with
                            most requests, or simply making sure that
                            the data sent with a request was actually
                            valid before updating the database. This
                            step probably took the longest of the three.

                    <p>
                        Now that I had a complete API, I had to make sure it actually
                        worked. I used Postman to make requests to every endpoint
                        that I had created. I needed to make sure that each endpoint
                        would send back the data I was expecting when I sent a
                        request. I saved examples of both the requests and responses
                        from every endpoint as well, which I would use when writing
                        out my documentation. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="grid-unit">
                    <h4>Documenting</h4>
                    <p>
                        At this point I had finished the API and confirmed that it was
                        working as intended. The last thing I needed to finish the back
                        end was clear documentation that I could refer back to while
                        building the front end client. This was an important step both
                        because I needed to learn how to do it, and also so that I could
                        have clear examples of how to send requests to my server, and
                        what kind of response to expect back. The image below is the
                        literal table of contents of that documentation, as well as a
                        brief overview of the endpoints and what to expect from them.

                        Now that I had a functional API which I could use to store and retrieve the data I needed, it was time to focus on the user
                        interface side of the project. Which ended up being a single page application built with React, which gives the user
                        several views through which they can interact with the data on the back end.

                        <p>
                            The first step was to figure out what systems
                            I would use to build and deploy the
                            application. I used React, because it is fast,
                            and easy to make changes in, and because
                            learning it was an overarching goal when
                            making this project. I used parcel to compile
                            and build the final application.

                        <p>
                            Once I had a blank canvas to start building
                            an application on top of, I started building
                            react components that I could then combine
                            into the full application. I made different
                            components for different views, forms,
                            buttons and more. Then all I had to do was
                            arrange them how I wanted, and make sure
                            each component was sending/receiving all
                            the data that it needed to function correctly.

                            I spent some time making it look pretty. This
                            included adding background colors, borders,
                            styling buttons, and changing the layout of
                            my components so they fell on the screen
                            where I wanted them to. During this process,
                            I made sure that the application would scale
                            to many different screen sizes, and that the
                            text would be high enough contrast that it
                            would be easily visible.

                    <p>
                        This was easily the most difficult and time consuming project that
                        I worked on during the Full Stack Immersion course at Career
                        Foundry. This was probably one of the most difficult projects I’ve
                        ever worked on. It was difficult for me to find adequate time to
                        work on it, as I was working full time, and trying to make time for
                        my family. I would sit down at my desk, and by the time I had
                        figured out where I was and what I was working on, I had already
                        run out of time. Ultimately, I just ended up sacrificing my sleep
                        schedule, and staying up until two or three o’clock in the morning
                        to work on this. I also spent ages trying to fix a bug in my front end
                        that ended up actually being an issue with how my back end was
                        handling the request. I had to get help from several different
                        people before I was able to get that working. Overall, however, this
                        was a very fulfilling project to work on, and I am proud of the final
                        result that I produced. If you want to check it out, it is hosted on

                    <h4>What would I add or change?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I was on a bit of a time crunch during this project, so I didn’t get to
                        do everything that I wanted to. I always wanted to add more than
                        ten movies to the database, or even better, I wanted to add the
                        ability for a user to add a movie to the list; I even considered
                        creating a second application specifically for reviewing movie
                        submissions before they were shown on the main site. I could
                        have spent a lifetime on styling and layout, but I had to move on to
                        other projects in order to complete my course on time. This
                        version of the app does not have the ability to view more
                        information about the director or genre, even though that
                        information is available in the database, so I would have liked to
                        implement a pop up when you click on the director or genre that
                        gives you that information. Other than that, I don’t think there was much I would change
                        about this project.
